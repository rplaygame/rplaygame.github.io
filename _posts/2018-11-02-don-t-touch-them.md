don t touch them is a retro pixel art indie game completely free and adictive gameplay you have to kill all the slimes that appear on the left and on the right side of the screen because if you don t do that they will kill you you have a bow and infinite arrows when you kill a slime the score increases by 1 also when the character fell he will bounce with the bubbles that there are on the floor but be carefull they bounce too i hope you like and enjoy the game
