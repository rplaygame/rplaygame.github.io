please see other games on my profile hextris is a fast paced puzzle game inspired by tetris blocks start on the edges of the screen and fall towards the inner blue hexagon the objective of the game is to prevent the blocks from stacking outside the area of the grey hexagon to do this you must rotate the hexagon to collect different stacks of blocks on each face aim to connect 3 or more blocks of the same color when they match up those 3 blocks are destroyed and the blocks above them slide down destroying multiple series of blocks grants combos whose durations are indicated by a quickly receding outline around the outer hexagon you lose once a stack forms outside the outer boundary
