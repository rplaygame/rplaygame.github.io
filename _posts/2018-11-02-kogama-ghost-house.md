1 my client gave me the task of putting an end to the haunted house of an isolated island 2 a helicopter brought me and my car to this island 3 i drove along the road until i arrived at the house 4 i parked my car next to the garage in the garage i found the key that opened the closed door of the house just as my client said 5 i found a map where a place was marked 3 notes from a failed detective who gave me information about the case and a closed chest 6 i followed the marking of the map the map took me to a cave 7 in this cave i had to cross 4 levels that bring me to 4 chains 8 i cut these chains so that the blocks fell down and opened the way to the key 9 with the key i could open the chest in the house there was a shovel and another map 10 at the same time the ghost girl appeared behind me i just saw her back then she turned to me she had no face and disappeared into flames 11 through her disappear and the text of the failed detective i knew what to do i should burn her remains 12 i looked at the map the map marks the top of the mountain 13 but first i took the shovel from the chest and dug the grave 14 i took the ax out of the garage with which i cut a tree 15 and with the wood i built a ramp so i could jump with the car to the mountain 16 i took the map out of the chest and jumped with the car to the mountain 17 after i climbed the mountain i got the item that should break the curse of the ghost girl 18 i put the item into the grave it started to burn 19 at the same time the ghost girl appeared without a face she came closer with a nasty smile and even closer she slowly dissolved as i burnt her remains when she had almost completely disappeared i could see her face and then she smiled i think she came to herself and was glad i saved her 20 the helicopter came to pick me up i climbed the rope and we flew back to kogama the case is closed
